    <h1>Indian cooking for absolute beginners</h1> 

<p>On this small website I collect my experience with indian cooking for people who experiment with it like me outside of India. This site is not a substitute for professional sites on Indian cooking, but it shows him how to approach this topic if you are neither a cook nor have learned this kind of cooking already at home.</p>

    <h2>How I came to this topic</h2>

      <p>I came to the topic of indian cooking mainly because one of my sons started eating only vegetarian at an early age. I wanted to cook something for him that wasn't just a poorer substitute for dishes with meat. I experimented somewhat fruitlessly with Indian recipes but then learned mostly through a cookbook, to cook things thatwere quite well received at least by my son and by my guests. I still cook mainly with this cookbook but I have learned a lot more in the meantime.<p> 

    <h2>Beginners recipes</h2> 

    <p>One learns to cook, as by the way also writing HTML, only in practice. The following are some of the recipes I make more often, they are all pretty simple. When cooking Indian, it is usually good to make a dish with legumes and maybe another dish with vegetables. Here are some recipes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Red lentils</li>
      <li>Eggplant curry</li>
      <li>Chickpea pancakes</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Cookbooks and other resources</h2>

<p>I mentioned it before: one cookbook in particular has helped me the most. Here also are a few other resources I refer back to often: </p>
<ul>
<li>Pure and Special: Gourmet Indian Vegetarian Cuisine

  <li>India Cookbook by Pushpesh Pant</li>
